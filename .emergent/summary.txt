The AI engineer iteratively developed the AIzamo website's frontend MVP, meticulously addressing user feedback. The work began with scaffolding core sections and mock data. Subsequent efforts concentrated on visual refinements: implementing a Warm AI Design System with custom colors, selecting IBM Plex Sans font, perfecting glass morphism buttons, and creating complex logo loading and navigation underline animations. The engineer effectively used temporary HTML demo files to present design options. Challenges like external font issues were noted. Recent efforts focused on fine-tuning the loading screen (particle performance, logo entrance, duration) and hero section (dynamic particles, interactive elements, animated stats, typewriter effect, slogan design, button alignment, and gradient highlight effects). The engineer successfully handled user requests for reverts and specific aesthetic adjustments, demonstrating strong responsiveness and technical execution. The latest task involved a comprehensive color palette swap across the entire frontend.

<product_requirements>
The user requires a professional website for AIzamo, an AI agency providing AI automations, website development, ad management, email/phone call automation, and AI agents for small businesses. The objective is to establish a serious, professional online presence. The website needs core sections: Hero (animated particles, clean nav, CTA), Our Services, About Us (placeholder), What Our Clients Think (carousel), Booking/Contact (form/calendar), Roadmap, and Footer. Design specifications included a warm hex code palette (#ece0d1, #dbc1ac, #967259, #634832, #38220f), high-tech animated particles, and a font distinguishing I from l (settled on 'IBM Plex Sans'). Later requests involved glass effects for CTAs, removal of an AI-Powered Business Solutions badge, improved navigation, a sophisticated logo loading animation (Wave Pixel Formation initially, then Digital Construction, Pixel Digitalization, various fade-ins, finally settling on a clean fade-in with matching navigation underline), and a split slogan Automate the Ordinary - Scale the Extraordinary with specific color emphasis.

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture with separate  and  directories.

**Detailed Directory Structure:**



**Key Files and Changes:**

-   :
    -   **Importance**: Main React entry point, handling routing and core component display.
    -   **Changes**: Controls  display before main content. No explicit code changes shown in this trajectory, but its role in orchestrating the loading screen and main app is central.
-   :
    -   **Importance**: Global CSS, Tailwind, custom styles, color variables, and animations.
    -   **Changes**: Extensively modified to define custom Warm AI Design System colors. It received multiple additions for various logo underline animations (Classic Sweep, Glow Wave, Double Line, Circuit Trace, Animated Dots, Electrical Spark, Wave Motion, Morphing Gradient, Particle Trail, Neural Network), ensuring all 10 concepts from  could be dynamically applied. It also contains animations for button hover effects, and later adapted to the new color palette (#402E2A, #947C70, #EDE3DB).
-   :
    -   **Importance**: Contains application-specific styles, including initial color variables and hero section particle animations.
    -   **Changes**: Updated color variables to the new sophisticated palette (, , , , ) and definitions for the dynamic particle system and interactive geometric elements in the Hero section.
-   :
    -   **Importance**: Implements the main navigation bar, including the AIzamo logo and its interactive underline.
    -   **Changes**: Repeatedly modified to implement chosen logo underline designs (e.g., Double Line, Circuit Trace, Classic Sweep), making them always visible. It leverages CSS classes and inline styles to apply complex hover animations and transitions based on user selections.
-   :
    -   **Importance**: The primary landing page section showcasing the brand slogan, statistics, and CTAs.
    -   **Changes**: Updated extensively:
        -   Typewriter effect for the slogan's sub-text, with cursor visibility control and adjustable typing speed.
        -   Animated count-up statistics, timed to appear after the typewriter effect.
        -   New split slogan Automate the Ordinary - Scale the Extraordinary with color emphasis and a dividing line.
        -   Button Get Started Today changed to Get Started, with arrow alignment and button width adjustments, eventually fixed with inline styles for precise control.
        -   View Our Services button color changed to a darker brown.
        -   Gradient highlight effect on hover for both CTA buttons, including text color change on hover for readability.
        -   Enhanced particle system, interactive geometric elements, and subtle background gradients, all optimized for lag-free performance.
-   :
    -   **Importance**: Handles the initial full-screen logo animation and loading experience.
    -   **Changes**:
        -   Pixels Flowing... text changed to Powering Up Workflows....
        -   Total animation duration reduced from 5s to 4s.
        -   Logo entrance animation iterated multiple times: from a complex enhanced version (rejected) to digital construction (rejected), pixel digitalization (rejected), a clean fade-in (accepted, then modified), and a dramatic fade-in (rejected). Finally reverted to the clean fade-in.
        -   Underline animation (Classic Sweep, matching Navigation.jsx) added to the loading logo, with timing adjustments to complete before screen transition.
        -   Particle effects and progress bar animations were heavily optimized for performance, using  for GPU acceleration and batch DOM updates.
-    files:
    -   **Importance**: Temporary demo files for showcasing design concepts to the user.
    -   **Changes**:  was a key part of the conversation, used to demonstrate various underline effects. While its content was not directly edited in the trajectory snippets, its existence and purpose were vital for user interaction.
-   :
    -   **Importance**: FastAPI backend for API endpoints.
    -   **Changes**: Minimal changes; primarily serves as an API endpoint, not actively modified for new features in this trajectory.

</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   **Backend Development**: Implement full backend functionality for contact forms, testimonials, and other dynamic features that currently rely on mock data.
-   **Chapaza Font Integration**: If the user provides the font files, integrate the 'Chapaza' font into the website.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary request, the AI engineer successfully implemented a comprehensive update to the website's color palette. The entire frontend now reflects a new sophisticated, earthy tone using the hex colors #402E2A (Dark Brown), #947C70 (Medium Taupe), and #EDE3DB (Light Cream/Beige).

This update involved:
-   **Global Color Variables**: Updating the CSS variables in  to the new palette.
-   **Gradient Animations**: Modifying various CSS animations defined in  (such as those for the loading screen particles, navigation underlines, and button hover effects) to utilize the new color scheme.
-   **Button Colors**: Adjusting the specific colors for primary and secondary buttons to ensure they align with the new palette and maintain readability.

The website currently features:
-   A highly optimized loading screen (4 seconds) with lag-free particle effects, a clean logo fade-in, and a matching Classic Sweep underline animation.
-   A dynamic Hero section with a split slogan Automate the Ordinary (lighter brown) and Scale the Extraordinary (darker brown) with a dividing line, a slower typewriter effect for the description, animated count-up statistics (triggered after typewriter), and two call-to-action buttons (Get Started and View Our Services).
-   The Get Started button has a refined layout with the arrow correctly aligned next to the text on one line, and both CTA buttons feature a professional gradient highlight effect on hover with text color changing for optimal readability.
-   The Made with Emergent badge has been removed for a cleaner, professional appearance.

The product is a visually polished and highly interactive frontend, now presenting a sophisticated aesthetic with the updated color palette.
