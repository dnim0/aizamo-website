The previous AI engineer successfully transitioned the AIzamo website from concept to a comprehensive frontend MVP. The work focused heavily on iterative design refinement based on user feedback, particularly around visual elements like fonts, button effects, and complex logo animations. Initial tasks involved scaffolding the core website sections with mock data. Subsequent iterations addressed specific user requests for aesthetic improvements, including custom color palettes, particle effects, font selection (with I vs l distinction), glass morphism buttons, and intricate logo loading/hover animations. The engineer effectively created numerous interactive demos for the user to select preferred designs, demonstrating a strong ability to translate abstract design ideas into functional code and present options clearly. Challenges, such as external font loading issues, were identified and gracefully handled with temporary fallbacks while maintaining the path for future integration. The current state is a highly polished frontend, ready for backend integration.

The user requires a professional website for AIzamo, an AI agency specializing in AI automations for small businesses, including website development, ad management, email/phone call automation, and AI agents. The goal is to scale AIzamo into a serious agency, necessitating a highly professional online presence.

The website was explicitly requested to include the following sections:
1.  **Hero Section**: Featuring web effects (animated particles) in the background, a clean navigation bar with a Contact Us CTA button.
2.  **Our Services**: Detailing offerings like AI automations, website management + SEO, ad management, and lead conversion.
3.  **About Us**: A placeholder section for a photo and personal content to be added later.
4.  **What Our Clients Think**: A revolving carousel of review cards including stars, client photos, names, and reviews.
5.  **Booking / Contact**: A form for inquiries or an integrated calendar for booking calls.
6.  **Roadmap**: A section outlining the company's future plans or process.
7.  **Footer**: Standard website footer content.

Design specifications included a specific hex code palette (#ece0d1, #dbc1ac, #967259, #634832, #38220f), high-tech animated particles, and a distinct font that differentiates uppercase I from lowercase l in AIzamo to avoid mispronunciation. Later requests included glass effects for CTA buttons, removal of a AI-Powered Business Solutions badge from the hero section, improved navigation bar design, and a sophisticated logo loading animation (center-to-navigation) with a left-to-right underline highlight for the navigation logo.

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture with separate  and  directories.

**Detailed Directory Structure:**



**Key Files and Changes:**

-   :
    -   **Importance**: The main React application entry point, setting up routing and integrating core components.
    -   **Changes**: Initially contained a basic Hello World display. Modified to incorporate  for client-side routing, and currently controls the display of the  before rendering the main website content (, , , etc.). It dynamically renders the loading screen based on a state (implicitly handled by the  component).
-   :
    -   **Importance**: Global CSS for Tailwind, defining base styles, color variables (from Shadcn and custom), and root variables.
    -   **Changes**: Updated to include the custom warm AI design system colors specified by the user (, , , etc.). Modified font-family to use 'IBM Plex Sans' with 'Poppins' as a fallback after initial attempts with 'Chapaza' failed, and then 'Poppins' was later replaced by 'IBM Plex Sans'. It also contains definitions for various animations and component styles as per the Warm AI Design System guidelines.
-   :
    -   **Importance**: Stores mock data for frontend components (services, testimonials) before backend integration.
    -   **Changes**: Created to provide initial content for  and  components, ensuring the frontend had rich, functional content from the start.
-   :
    -   **Importance**: Implements the main navigation bar.
    -   **Changes**: Significantly refactored to incorporate user feedback:
        -   Initial setup with basic navigation links and a Contact Us CTA.
        -   Transformed to feature a Stunning Logo Design (initially a gradient circle with sparkles, later updated to display selected logo concepts), glass morphism effects (), subtle gradient accents, and interactive navigation items with animated underlines and shimmer effects on the CTA.
-   :
    -   **Importance**: The main hero section of the landing page.
    -   **Changes**: Implemented with animated particle background effects, a compelling headline, key statistics, and CTA buttons. Initially included an AI-Powered Business Solutions badge, which was later removed at the user's request. Spacing was adjusted to move the motto further from the navigation bar.
-   :
    -   **Importance**: A newly created component to handle the full-screen logo introduction animation.
    -   **Changes**: Created to implement the Wave Pixel Formation effect, where the AIzamo logo forms from converging pixels. It manages the loading state and transitions smoothly to the main application content after completion.
-    files (, , , , , , , ):
    -   **Importance**: These are temporary, standalone HTML files created to demonstrate various design options (fonts, logo concepts, animation effects, underline styles) to the user for selection without directly altering the main application's live state for each trial.
    -   **Changes**: Each file was generated dynamically to showcase specific design elements, often including embedded CSS for animations and interactive JavaScript for demos.  was specifically debugged and enhanced for better visibility and interactivity.
-   :
    -   **Importance**: FastAPI backend providing API endpoints.
    -   **Changes**: Minimal changes in this trajectory, primarily serving as the API endpoint for basic Hello World and a  endpoint (though not yet integrated with the frontend in this trajectory).
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   **Backend Development**: Implement full backend functionality for contact forms, testimonials, and other dynamic features that currently rely on mock data.
-   **Logo Underline Design Selection**: User needs to select a preferred design for the navigation logo's left-to-right underline highlight from the  demo.
-   **Chapaza Font Integration**: If the user provides the font files, integrate the 'Chapaza' font into the website.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary request, the AI engineer was working on refining and showcasing design options for the website's logo and navigation bar.
The current state of the product is a highly polished and interactive frontend:
-   **Visual Design**: The website adheres to the Warm AI Design System guidelines, utilizing the specified hex codes (#ece0d1, #dbc1ac, #967259, #634832, #38220f) for a warm, professional aesthetic.
-   **Font**: The primary font is IBM Plex Sans, chosen for its clarity and distinct separation of 'I' and 'l', ensuring the AIzamo brand name is unambiguous.
-   **Hero Section**: Features high-tech animated particles in the background, with the motto Scale Your Business with AI Automation correctly spaced from the navigation bar. The previously present AI-Powered Business Solutions badge has been removed.
-   **Buttons**: All call-to-action buttons (e.g., Get Started Today) have an elegant glass morphism effect on hover and click, adding a premium feel.
-   **Navigation Bar**: The navigation bar is significantly enhanced with a professional design, currently showcasing Concept 1: Gradient Typography for the logo, with interactive navigation items. It also has an animated underline highlight for the logo on hover, specifically the Classic Sweep effect.
-   **Logo Introduction**: The website now features a stunning full-screen loading animation using the Wave Pixel Formation effect. This transition shows the AIzamo logo forming from converging pixels as the website loads, creating a unique and high-tech first impression.
-   **Demo Files**: Several  files (, , , , , , , ) exist in the  directory, serving as interactive showcases for different design choices. The  demo was recently fixed to ensure all 10 logo underline concepts are clearly visible and interactive for the user to select from.
